***User***

Ok, below I am going to provide a full spec of what I *want* from RayCoder, a project which we are currently building.

Currently there are several competing SoTA tools for agentic coding: Cursor (which you're running in), and many different agentic code setups. There are many features across them that I enjoy:

1. Planning - Claude Code, Cursor do this
2. Subagents - Coolest feature but also the hardest - only Claude Code supports it
3. Compacting chat history with summaries - Cursor, OpenCode
4. Running bash commands - basically all solutions
5. Extremely efficient token usage via context handling - OpenCode.
6. MCP servers, hooks, LSPs - Basically all. Just varies in the degree of quality.
7. Diffing, searching, many other features.

My broad goal here is to make an agentic system that is just as good as any of these tools at all of the features that they tackle. 

More specifically, RayCode is intended to be as modular as possible, so that we can have proper abstractions that let us swap between providers, models, configurations, tool syntaxes, and different loops. The intention is an agentic framework that allows us to replicate *any* Agentic Coder product's *exact* workflow using a YAML config that is both readable and extremely customizable. I have attached an example of a config we are using to test a replication of OpenCode's workflow. I have also attached the latest spec document of RayCoder here. We need this thing to be as modular and configurable as possible, as we are eventually going to use it to *completely* optimize configurations and prompts for individual models using a mix of hyperparameter optimization, RL, and prompt evolution. We have already scoped that out, and I have attached that document here as well.

There is also the added caveat that we are building RayCoder to work in gVisor sandboxes that work as Ray Actors, as we will eventually use this tool at a massive scale when it is done. However, we can de-couple that and just look at it as an agentic coder for now. 

I want every piece and approach that we borrow to be modular and configurable, so that we can swap out approaches as needed. I want to have every feature, but alternative ones are swappable via config. This way, I can do A/B testing and even hyper-parameter optimization on configs to maximize any given model's performance.

There is one ULTRA-CRITICAL piece of the implementation though that we need to get right:

### Tool-Calling

This is a field of study within itself. There are many, *many* different approaches to this. The idea here is to give a model access to a tool defined by some schema, create a deterministic way to inform the model of the tool schema and availability via appending to some part of the prompt process, and creating a robust parser to parse out said tool calls and arguments. The problem is, there are many competing standards and approaches to this, and different models have different sensitivities to it.

Some model providers even handle it by taking tool schemas via the API, and don't tell us how they're informing the model about tool calls or parsing them. I would love to be able to just do this, but it is inconsistent between providers, and we have another reason we can't do this that I'll describe below in the **Syntax Standard Composition** section.

Other apps and projects implement their own tool calling, including the schema, prompting, syntax structure, and parsing. OpenCode does this, I believe, and it uses a code block format for it. I'll attach the spec for what we found on it as well. We also do this via an abstracted class for syntaxes, and have so far opted to take an encapsulated python syntax approach. Many other products use XML-like calls.

Abstracting the syntax structures into their own classes is the best way for us to do this, because it allows us to make it fully modular and configurable like we did before.

However, like I said, there are many competing standards, and it is not clear AT ALL what works best. That is why it is *critically* important to glance over at these other projects' implementations to see where its at. The field itself is also constantly changing. 


### Syntax Standard Composition

One reason we can't have just one tool calling standard, is because of diffs. Diff tool calls are fundamentally different from normal tool calls, than can typically be represented as a tool and a list of arguments. Models really need an easy-to-understand format to do diffs, so that they can just write code without needing to worry about properly encapsulating text.

This means we need to accommodate at least two standards, and sometimes more (like perhaps a third for bash commands). For this reason, we created a way to composite together our tool calling syntax classes. We also cannot get diffs working with model providers tool call schemas, because it is simply too unique. There are several formats for diffs:

1. Aider - Seems to be the friendliest, by far. Only problem is it doesn't support 'creating' files
2. Unified diff - Closest to git patches.
3. OpenCode format - Might be the same as unified diff. Also similar to git patches.
4. v4a - Don't know much about it. OpenAI claims their models are trained for it, but testers say they still do better on Aider.

There is also the option that we simply make a small change to Aider that supports creating files. All of this needs to be considered for implementation, and we *need* to extensively scan how other projects are implementing these. However, I would love the option to offload more standard tool calls to API providers. This would be optional in the config though, as our big point is that *everything* is configurable.
### Tool Call Prompting

Abstracting the tool call syntaxes as factories requires a few things:

1. A method for parsing out tool schemas, and deterministically constructing a prompt that composes an explanation of the available tools.
2. A method for parsing the tool calls from a model response.

Number one is tricky, because it comes down to prompt engineering. There are also multiple places we can put constructed prompts.

* You might want to hand-craft an appended section to the system prompt finely explaining how to go about its behavior.
* You might want to append a compiled prompt of available tools to the end of each user turn, so that the model knows what to do.
* You might want to do some combination of the above, at differing levels of detail, elaboration, and length.

I made it so we can cache *compiled* system prompts in light of (1), with hash checking to match the compiled/cached prompts to the same config. I did this so that we can manually tweak and reword it to get better performance under the same config.
We prototype with small models, at the moment `gpt-5-nano`, because they will often make mistakes when our scaffolding isn't optimal. It helps us get stuff working quickly. 


### Turn Strategy

There is also the concern of how we want parsed tool calls to take place. All models use the **System**, **Assistant**, **User** conversational format. The question is, do we return tool call results in user messages for many turns, or do we continue the same assistant messages with results of tool calls, so that user turns are more scarce? This is just one more thing that I need you to see how modern projects deal with this.


### Tool Calling Concurrency

Our current approach allows our coder to call multiple tools on one turn. It's starting to seem like this doesn't make sense. Our validation allows for us to specify if a tool is `blocking`, but we may need finer controls than this. Like all the other concerns, you need to see how other projects are implementing this.

### End of a Coder Request

I have some concerns about what the exit condition of a coder request should be. Maybe it should be a model making a turn where it does not call any tools? This is prone to happen often with a very small model. Maybe we should use a special character sequence to indicate it, and explain how to use it. This confused gpt-5-nano, and caused it to make some stupid mistakes with its syntax. Our current approach is to just have a `mark_task_complete()` tool call. However, the model often makes changes with diffs, and calls this all on the same turn. 

### Concerns

These are the many, many concerns I have when building this. I want to be able to try all of them, and I want us to have configurations in place so that we can completely copy the implementations of Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Crush, and whatever other products are doing these kinds of tasks. The biggest concern is finding the right abstractions for the YAML that are configurable. A good schema here can be used as the base point for specing the entire project. Current limitations are all in the control loop. I also have concerns about how, for example OpenCode has multiple modes:

1. A plan mode
2. An Agent/Build mode

Claude Code also has multiple modes, steps, and corresponding prompts:

1. It always uses a plan mode with a checklist at the beginning of each request. You can even assign a separate model for this.
2. It then goes out and builds stuff using the checklist, and occasionally crossing items off the checklist.
3. It can spawn subagents off of one main request thread, when then go and complete designated tasks. 

Many of these coders also have a set of prompts and setups for *compacting/summarizing* a conversation, in order to save on context. I need to be able to flesh out different modes here from a config, possibly with different tooling. I have a half baked idea of a YAML:

```yaml
scaffolding_construction:
  # - "System Prompt"
  preamble:
    - "system_prompt"
    - "[CACHE] tools_available_prompt"
  
  request_loop:
    - "[USER-OPTIONAL] PLAN CHECKLIST"
    - "ENABLE BUILDER"
    - "tools_available_prompt"

  
    - "Tool Outputs"
    - "Tool Call Results"
```

This is actually a legitimately horrible schema, but I'm hoping you can see where my head is at. Out current GPT-5-nano OpenCode replication YAML looks like this:

```yaml
# OpenCode-identical tool config for C filesystem task using gpt-5-nano

workspace: ./agent_ws_c
output:
  json: ./session_out.json
  markdown: ./session_out.md

  confidence_threshold: 0.6  # Minimum confidence for non-tool completion
  text_sentinels:
    - "TASK COMPLETE"
    - "ALL TESTS PASSED"
    - "IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE"
    - ">>>>>> END RESPONSE"

concurrency:
  # Nonblocking tool ids (may run multiple in the same turn concurrently)
  nonblocking_tools:
    - apply_unified_patch
    - apply_search_replace
    - create_file_from_block
    - read
    - read_file
    - glob
    - grep
    - list
    - list_dir
    - patch

deployment:
  mode: development
  isolation: true
  mirror_results: true
```

There are some good things here, but we need much finer control over the loop, tools, and schema. I also have no idea how to cleanly represent different modes, like the ones I described, or how to point at different prompts.

I need you to *extensively* think about this, do some digging on any type of SoTA implementation details that may help us out (there likely won't be many for abstractions, as this is quite new), and start with a schema for these config YAMLs, plus any other relevant abstractions and separations, that would truly allow us to replicate *anything*. It should allow full customization of *everything* I've described.


***Assistant***

Awesome brief — thank you. I read your two attachments carefully and cross‑checked current SoTA practices in Cursor, Claude Code, OpenCode, Aider, MCP, and provider tool‑calling so we can fold the best ideas into a single, **maximally modular** configuration surface for RayCoder. Below I propose:

1. a **unified config schema** (YAML) that can replicate the workflows of Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Aider‑style diffs, and provider‑native tool calling – with clean abstractions for **dialects**, **modes**, **turn strategy**, **concurrency**, **exit conditions**, and **prompt injection**;
2. the **runtime architecture** the schema maps to (how compilers, parsers, validators, executors, and providers interact);
3. two short **profiles** that show how to match **OpenCode** and **Claude Code** behaviors just by swapping config;
4. a **tool‑calling plan** that lets you mix provider‑native tools and text‑dialects (including friendly diff formats) in one loop, plus how to make “create file” rock‑solid;
5. how this plugs into your existing Ray + gVisor + LSP actors and your optimization stack (rewards/HPO/bandits) so it **learns** per‑model defaults over time. &#x20;

---

## What the current SoTA is doing (grounding for design)

* **Planning modes.** Cursor’s Agent exposes explicit *Planning* with to‑do lists / queues for long‑horizon tasks, and keeps that plan visible and updated as it works. That’s a distinct **mode** with different tools enabled/disabled. ([Cursor][1], [learn-cursor.com][2])
  Claude Code has an explicit **Plan Mode** that *cannot* edit/run until approved, plus “step‑by‑step” and auto‑accept modes. Treat these as first‑class modes in the loop. ([ClaudeLog][3], [nikiforovall.blog][4])

* **Subagents.** Claude Code supports **subagents** (specialized assistants with their own prompts, tools, and context windows). Our schema should let you spawn subagents with per‑agent toolsets, budgets, and sandboxes. ([Anthropic][5])

* **OpenCode’s mode split.** OpenCode documents a **Plan Agent** (no write/edit/patch/bash) and a **General/Build** agent; tool availability is part of the “mode.” We’ll mirror that directly. ([opencode][6])

* **Diff formats matter a lot.** Aider showed unified diffs made GPT‑4 Turbo \~3× less “lazy,” dramatically reducing commentary instead of edits. Keep **multiple diff dialects** and let the config (or an adaptive policy) choose per‑model. Also document add‑file semantics clearly. ([Aider][7], [GitHub][8])
  (Git’s unified‑diff conventions for create/delete use `/dev/null`; we’ll use those headers for a provider‑agnostic *Create File via Patch* path.) ([GitHub][9], [Git SCM][10])

* **Provider‑native tool calling is evolving.**
  *OpenAI* has **Structured Outputs** with JSON‑Schema and `strict:true`, plus **parallel function calling**; use these when enabled, but keep our own text dialects as a drop‑in alternative. ([OpenAI][11], [OpenAI Cookbook][12])
  *Anthropic* constructs an internal **tool‑use system prompt** from your tool specs; that means you should be able to choose “provider‑native” vs “explicit text‑dialect” per run. ([Anthropic][13])

* **MCP servers are quickly becoming the “tool bus.”** Treat MCP servers as another tool provider class in the schema (filesystem, VCS, DBs, CI, etc.). ([Model Context Protocol][14], [Model Context Protocol][15])

---

## The big idea: separate *what* you’re doing from *how the model talks about it*

* **Modes** (plan/build/test/fix/compact) describe *what the agent is allowed to do* and *which prompts/guards* it uses.
* **Dialects** describe *how* the model expresses tool calls and code edits (provider‑native tools; text‑based JSON/XML calls; unified diff; Aider SEARCH/REPLACE; “bash blocks”).
* **Selectors** bind them: per‑model/per‑provider/per‑task rules choose the dialect (with fallback chains) and the mode sequencing for a request.
* **Validators & Schedulers** handle ordering, blocking/parallelism, rate limits and exit decisions.
* **Prompt compilers** synthesize the **Tool Catalog** and guardrails, inserted into **system** and/or **per‑turn** slots with cacheable hashes, just as you outlined.&#x20;

### Why this schema hits your requirements

* **Tool‑calling is *composable***: `tools.provider_native` (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini) *and* `tools.dialects` (your own text formats) can coexist, with `selection` rules and `order` fallbacks per model/provider/tool kind. This is the “two‑track” approach you asked for. ([OpenAI][11], [Anthropic][13])
* **Diffs are first‑class**: `create_file_policy` codifies add‑file semantics for udiff (using `/dev/null` headers), and “prefer\_write\_file\_tool” for Aider‑style formats. ([GitHub][9])
* **Modes are explicit** (plan/build/compact), mirroring Cursor, Claude Code, and OpenCode. You can enable/disable side‑effects per mode and wire distinct prompts. ([Cursor][1], [ClaudeLog][3], [opencode][6])
* **Turn strategy** lets you choose: *tool results as tool‑role* vs *as user messages*, and whether assistant messages continue or interleave with “user” relays.
* **Concurrency** moves beyond a single `blocking` bit: you define *groups*, *barriers*, and *one‑of* guards (e.g., “at most one bash per turn”), matching real agent loops.
* **Exit conditions** are arbitrated: explicit tool (*mark\_task\_complete*), provider “finish\_reason,” text sentinels, and natural stopping heuristics.
* **Prompt injection points** are deterministic and cacheable (system and per‑turn), so you can A/B *where* you list tools (system appendix only, per‑turn short catalog, or both).
* **Telemetry slots** line up with your reward model so you can HPO/bandit‑tune per model/provider/dialect automatically.&#x20;

---

## Runtime architecture it maps to (brief)

* **PromptCompiler** builds the exact **system** + **per‑turn** messages, including *Tools Catalog* (full/minimal) and mode‑specific inserts, cached by hash.&#x20;
* **DialectManager** (your CompositeToolCaller) selects render/parse per step using `tools.dialects.selection`, tries fallbacks, and emits validation/repair stats (SVS/ACS/CPS).&#x20;
* **DiffExecutor** implements udiff/opencode/aider handlers with **add‑file** normalization and emits PAS/HMR/AFC metrics. (Use git apply under the hood so `/dev/null` creates are truthy.) ([GitHub][9])
* **ProviderAdapter** offloads to *native tools* when `provider_native.enabled`, using OpenAI **Structured Outputs** or Anthropic **tool\_use**. Parallel tools are allowed when the provider supports them. ([OpenAI][11], [OpenAI Cookbook][12])
* **TurnScheduler** enforces `concurrency` rules (groups, barriers, at\_most\_one\_of) and handles **tool result relay** according to `turn_strategy`.
* **CompletionArbiter** gathers stop signals (tool/text/provider/natural) per `completion` config.
* **LSPEnhancedSandbox** remains exactly as spec’d; Ray + gVisor isolation and LSP diagnostics on write are unchanged.&#x20;

---

## Tool‑calling plan (the “ultra‑critical” part)

1. **Provider‑native path** (when stable):

   * Build JSON Schemas with `strict:true` on OpenAI; use Anthropic’s `tools` so they build their own tool‑use system prompt for you. Prefer native for simple/atomic calls (read/list/grep, small writes). ([OpenAI][11], [Anthropic][13])

2. **Text‑dialect path** (always available):

   * Keep **multiple** parsers/renderers: `unified_diff`, `aider_search_replace`, `opencode_patch`, `bash_block`, `json_call`, `xml_call`.
   * Use **per‑model defaults** and **fallback chains** (e.g., GPT‑4 family → `unified_diff` first; Claude → `aider_search_replace` first). Your policy can adapt online (bandit selection using PAS×LED×TPF). ([Aider][7])

3. **Create‑file strategy**:

   * For `unified_diff`, require `--- /dev/null` headers (and optionally `new file mode 100644`) so `git apply` is deterministic. For Aider formats, prefer a dedicated `write_file` tool (or your `create_file_from_block`) to avoid fragile heredocs. ([GitHub][9])

4. **Prompting the tools list** (deterministic & cacheable):

   * *System appendix* contains the long form (specs/examples); *per‑turn tail* contains a short menu of just‑enabled tools for the **current mode**. Anthropic already does an internal “tool prompt” — your explicit catalog helps when you’re not using provider‑native tools or when mixing modes. ([Anthropic][13])

5. **Validation & retries**:

   * Enforce `ordering` (“read\_before\_edit”, “≤1 bash/turn”, “diffs blocking”), auto‑repair ≤1 for malformed JSON, then fallback to the next dialect. Log SVS/ACS/CPS. (These emit the signals your reward model consumes.)&#x20;

> **Note on “v4a”**: I couldn’t find a public, formal “v4a diff” spec; keep it behind a feature flag as an experimental dialect until a stable spec emerges. (We’ll slot it under `tools.dialects.order` when/if you adopt it.)

---

## Two **profiles** to prove fidelity

### A) **OpenCode‑style** (plan agent → build agent; OpenCode patch + udiff)

```yaml
extends: base.yaml
profile: { name: "opencode-compat" }

modes:
  - name: plan
    enabled: true
    tools_enabled: ["read_file","list_dir","glob","grep"]
    tools_disabled: ["write_file","apply_unified_patch","apply_search_replace","run_shell"]  # mirrors OpenCode Plan Agent  :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}
    prompt: "plan"

  - name: build
    enabled: true
    prompt: "builder"
    tools_enabled: ["*"]

tools:
  dialects:
    order: ["opencode_patch","unified_diff","aider_search_replace","bash_block"]
    selection:
      by_model:
        "openrouter/openai/*": ["opencode_patch","unified_diff"]
        "anthropic/*": ["aider_search_replace","opencode_patch"]

turn_strategy:
  relay: tool_role
  flow: assistant_continuation

completion:
  primary: hybrid
  text_sentinels: ["TASK COMPLETE","ALL TESTS PASSED",">>>>>> END RESPONSE"]
```

### B) **Claude Code‑style** (Plan Mode + subagents)

```yaml
extends: base.yaml
profile: { name: "claude-code-compat" }

providers:
  default_model: anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet

modes:
  - name: plan
    tools_disabled: ["write_file","apply_unified_patch","apply_search_replace","run_shell"]  # Plan Mode: no side effects  :contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}
    prompt: "plan"
  - name: build
    prompt: "builder"
    subagents:
      enabled: true
      supervisor: "sequential"
      agents:
        - name: "test-runner"
          model: "anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet"
          tools: ["run_shell","read_file"]
          budget: { max_tokens: 4000 }
        - name: "doc-updater"
          model: "anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet"
          tools: ["apply_unified_patch","read_file"]

tools:
  dialects:
    order: ["aider_search_replace","unified_diff","bash_block"]   # Claude tends to prefer Aider S/R first
```

---

## Concurrency & turn strategy (what we changed vs today)

* **Groups** allow you to parallelize *safe reads* and *LSP diagnostics* while serializing edits and bash. Where supported, we also allow **provider parallel tool calls** (OpenAI, Anthropic) — controlled by `providers.*.params.parallel_tools` and `concurrency.groups`. ([OpenAI][16])
* **Relay** choices support either *(a) tool results as tool-role* messages\* (cleaner for parsing) or *(b) tool results injected as user messages* (compatibility mode).
* **Exit** is no longer brittle: a tool‑based finish, provider “finish\_reason,” text sentinels, and a natural “no‑tool‑turns” threshold all feed a **CompletionArbiter** that you can weight/disable in config.

---

## Compacting/summarization

Put compacting into its own **mode** with its own prompt and **trigger** (`tokens_remaining_pct_lt`), so you can swap strategies (lossless map‑reduce vs lossy “gist”) and model choice by config without touching the loop. (OpenCode’s *Auto Compact* concept maps cleanly here; Claude Code has similar guidance.) ([GitHub][17])

---

## Where this plugs into your code today

* The schema lines up directly with your **PromptCompiler**, **CompositeToolCaller**, **DevSandboxV2 + LSP** and Ray actors; the LSP‑enhanced sandbox and containerization flags remain the same.&#x20;
* The **telemetry fields** match your **unified reward model** (SVS/ACS/CPS/PAS/HMR/LED/TPFΔ/TE/LE/TOE/SPA) so your HPO/bandit/prompt‑evolver can optimize **per model/provider/dialect** and select winners automatically.&#x20;

---

## A few pragmatic implementation notes

* **Aider‑style S/R vs Unified Diff**: ship both; default **udiff** for OpenAI models (per Aider’s results), **S/R** for Claude; let the **bandit** flip defaults if telemetry disagrees in your workload. ([Aider][7])
* **Create file**: udiff with `/dev/null` is your most robust text‑only path; where models struggle, fall back to a simple `write_file` tool. ([GitHub][9])
* **MCP**: treat MCP servers as a tool provider class (filesystem/db/CI), and surface them via the Tools Catalog; many shops are moving this way. ([Model Context Protocol][14])
* **Provider quirks**: keep **Structured Outputs strict** on OpenAI, and rely on Anthropic’s `tools` prompt construction when `provider_native.enabled=true`. These settings are visible in `providers.models[].params`. ([OpenAI][11], [Anthropic][13])

---

## What you can do next (low‑lift)

1. **Drop this schema** into your `agent_configs/` and wire the small glue layers (most are already in your tree): PromptCompiler, DialectManager selection, CompletionArbiter, and TurnScheduler.&#x20;
2. **Add two presets**: `opencode-compat.yaml` and `claude-code-compat.yaml` (above) and verify they reproduce the expected behaviors (plan‑only vs plan→build, subagents on/off, diff format order). ([opencode][6], [ClaudeLog][3])
3. **Flip on learning**: enable your reward logging fields and start the HPO/bandit loop to converge per‑model defaults for dialects and prompts.&#x20;

If you want, I can convert the schema into a JSON‑Schema contract and a minimal Python loader (with validation & defaults) and hand you **ready‑to‑run** `opencode-compat.yaml` and `claude-code-compat.yaml` files.

***User***

I want you to consider a few more things, like Kilo Code, Augment, Cline, Crush, Github Copilot, and OpenCode if you haven't. I saw that Cline has a 'deep plan' mode that I would like our abstractions to be able to replicate. I also need us to be able to point to specific prompts, as we've stored in our `implementations/` folder for organization, so that we can use said prompts as our templates on certain designs. I also would like an abstraction system that will allow us to *evolve* prompts under a given system.

We will eventually need to be able to modify our schema to support bayesian hyperband with wandb, as well as RL and/or prompt evolution. I'll again attach the document for how we plan to construct that, but I'll also include two configs from a project where I implemented my wandb hyperparameter schema. One config is a single run, and one is for a sweep.

One other thing is that we separated our tools out into their own separate YAML files, and we kind of point at them with our configs. I think we should still do that, but add an abstraction layer inside of these agent configs so that we can customize things like:

1. tool syntax style
2. tool descriptions
3. Fallback behavior, so that we might *prefer* that a tool use a provider's tool schema over API, but when its not available, go back to one of our syntaxes.
4. tool names.

We could control these at the top-level of the agent configs apart from the modes, and have the mode configs reference them by id. These could point to *actual* tool implementations which are hardcoded behaviors, maybe still stored in those YAML files in our modules. I've attached here the current YAML config for one of our tools, as well as a config for one of the tools from Claude Code. It may or may not help you. Our implementation yaml is `run_shell.yaml`, and the claude code one is `WebSearch.tool.yaml`.

See if you can improve the abstractions with all of these in mind, and see if you can make indentical clone configs to all of the products out there, assuming we're able to rip out the exact tool schema and prompts from said tools.



***Assistant***

Fantastic—let’s fold **Kilo Code**, **Augment**, **Cline (Deep Plan)**, **Crush**, **GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode/Workspace)** and **OpenCode** into the abstraction so RayCoder can 1) **clone** their workflows and 2) **optimize/evolve** them over time with Bayesian Hyperband + RL/prompt‑evolution, **without** changing your core engine.

Below you’ll find:

1. **What these products do that we should model** (with sources).
2. A refined **RayCoder Config v2** schema that adds: *prompt packs & evolution*, *tool overlays & aliases*, *provider‑native ↔ text‑dialect fallbacks*, *mode families including Deep Plan*, and *HPO/RL knobs wired to wandb*.
3. A **tool abstraction layer** that respects your separate tools YAMLs while letting configs override names/descriptions/syntax/fallbacks.
4. **Clone profiles** (ready‑to‑fill) for: **Cline Deep Plan**, **Kilo Code**, **Augment Agent/Remote Agent**, **Copilot Agent Mode/Workspace**, **OpenCode**, **Crush**—each just swaps prompts, tools, and turn policy.
5. How this plugs into your current spec and optimization stack. &#x20;

---

## 1) What to capture from each product (for fidelity)

* **Cline**: explicit **Plan vs Act**; a documented **/deep‑planning** mode that silently investigates, asks clarifying questions, outputs a multi‑step plan & task list before any edits. Treat this as a dedicated **Deep Plan** mode with specific prompts/tool gating. ([DataCamp][1], [Cline][2])
* **Kilo Code**: a fork that merges features from **Roo Code** + **Cline**, with planning/build/fix flows—means we need a *combinable* mode set and the ability to import prompts and tools from multiple “lineages.” ([GitHub][3], [Visual Studio Marketplace][4], [DeepWiki][5])
* **Augment**: IDE Agent **and** **Remote Agent** that can run **multiple agents in parallel** in a managed environment; supports “auto” mode. We need **subagents** + **parallel orchestration** and an **isolation target** per agent (local or remote sandbox). ([Visual Studio Marketplace][6], [docs.augmentcode.com][7])
* **Crush** (Charm): a **terminal‑first** agent that wires your tools/workflows to your LLM of choice; emphasize **TUI/CLI‑first** loop and shell‑centric tools. ([GitHub][8])
* **GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode / Workspace)**: planning → build → test → PR flows, **sub‑agents**, and a higher‑level “agents panel/mission control” that tracks tasks. We need a **job controller** concept and “workspace/PR” tooling. ([Visual Studio Code][9], [The GitHub Blog][10], [IT Pro][11])
* **OpenCode**: terminal‑native agent with a **Plan Agent** (read‑only) and **General/Build** agent; patch‑oriented editing. We should keep **patch dialects** first‑class and model plan/build mode split. ([opencode][12], [GitHub][13])

Your current RayCoder spec already has the right primitives to house this (tools + dialects; provider‑native routing; LSP‑enhanced sandbox; Ray actors). We’ll add the missing **abstraction surfaces**. &#x20;

---

## 2) **RayCoder Config v2** — new schema surfaces

> Backwards‑compatible with your existing YAMLs; adds **prompt packs**, **tool overlays**, **provider/dialect fallback policies**, **mode families** (incl. Deep Plan), **subagents**, and **HPO/RL** blocks. Caches compiled prompts by hash exactly as in your spec.&#x20;

**Why this meets your asks**

* **Prompt packs + evolution** let you point directly at `implementations/...` files and **persist prompt mutations** produced by the evolver—cached with content‑hashes per your current compiler.&#x20;
* **Tool overlays** let configs rename tools (“run\_shell” → “bash”), *override descriptions*, choose a **syntax style**, and specify **provider‑native → text dialect fallback chains**—without touching the base YAMLs. (See your current `run_shell.yaml` for parity.)&#x20;
* **Dialect selection** stays model/tool‑aware (e.g., udiff first on GPT‑4‑ish; Aider S/R first on Claude), matching your diff strategy and allowing AB/bandit adaptation.&#x20;
* **Deep Plan** is an explicit mode with its own prompt and tool gate to mirror **Cline’s /deep‑planning**. ([Cline][2])
* **Subagents + parallelism** let you mirror **Augment Remote Agent** (parallel agents) and **Copilot sub‑agents**, all within Ray/gVisor isolation. ([docs.augmentcode.com][7], [The GitHub Blog][10])
* **HPO/RL hooks** match your optimization spec (Bayesian Hyperband + prompt evolution with a small controller); metrics map 1:1 to your reward model.&#x20;

---

## 3) Tool abstraction layer (keeping your tools in separate YAML files)

You already ship per‑tool YAML (e.g., `run_shell.yaml`), with **provider routing**, **supported syntaxes**, and **blocking/max\_per\_turn**. The v2 schema adds **config‑level overlays & aliases** so you can adjust *names*, *descriptions*, *syntax style*, and *fallback order* **without** editing the tool file:

* **Example base tool** (yours): `run_shell.yaml` (supports native, json\_block, yaml\_command; prefers yaml\_command; one per turn; provider fallback strategy).&#x20;
* **Example external tool** (Claude Code): `WebSearch.tool.yaml` exposes a JSON Schema, usage notes (date awareness, domain include/block), etc.—this becomes just another registry entry you can toggle per mode/profile.&#x20;

RayCoder v2 loader:

* Loads **tool registries** → applies **overlays** (rename, description, syntax) → builds a **Tools Catalog** → compiles provider‑native schemas where enabled → publishes a **per‑mode** tool menu to the model (system appendix + per‑turn short list). This aligns with your spec’s `tool_yaml_loader.py` and prompt‑compiler hashing.&#x20;

---

## 4) Clone profiles (drop‑in drafts)

> These are scaffolds—fill the `prompts.packs` paths with the corresponding extracted prompts; switch toolsets as needed. They demonstrate **how** to clone the workflows.

## 5) How this installs into your current codebase

* **PromptCompiler** already composes cached system/per‑turn prompts; we only add **packs** + **evolution store**.&#x20;
* **CompositeToolCaller** already supports multiple dialects; the new **overlays/aliases** sit above your `tool_yaml_loader`.&#x20;
* **Provider adapters**: we continue to route to **provider‑native** tools when enabled (OpenAI structured outputs, Anthropic tool\_use) with **strict schemas**, otherwise fall back to a configured **text dialect**—your `provider_routing.py` is already set up for this.&#x20;
* **LSP‑enhanced sandbox** and **Ray/gVisor** actors remain unchanged; subagents simply request a **shared or isolated** workspace.&#x20;
* **Optimization stack**: your reward and HPO design drops straight in (SVS/ACS/CPS/PAS/HMR/LED/SBS/TPFΔ/TE/LE/TOE/SPA). The `hpo` block above matches your **Bayesian Hyperband** patterns; the `rl_and_evolution` block maps to your **Prompt Evolver**/RL plan.&#x20;

---

## 6) Notes on diffs & creation semantics (important for fidelity)

* Keep **Unified Diff** and **Aider SEARCH/REPLACE** as equal citizens; default **udiff** for GPT‑4‑ish, **S/R** for Claude, with bandit‑style adaptation via telemetry.
* For file creation: udiff with `--- /dev/null` + `+++ b/<path>` (optionally `new file mode 100644`), or prefer a `write_file` tool for Aider S/R; expose both via **create\_file\_policy**. (You already implement these choices.)&#x20;

---

## 7) Two concrete examples from your current tool files

* **`run_shell.yaml`** already encodes **native primary** on OpenAI with **fallback\_formats** and a **max\_per\_turn** guard—exactly what the **overlays** mechanism needs to reference and override per profile.&#x20;
* **`WebSearch.tool.yaml`** (Claude Code‑style) demonstrates plugging an external JSON Schema tool straight into the registry and then selectively enabling it in **plan** or **deep\_plan** modes.&#x20;

---

## 8) What to evolve & sweep (starter keys)

* **Prompts:** micro‑planning presence; udiff context lines; explicit “one‑bash‑per‑turn” rule phrasing; add‑file guidance text.
* **Dialects:** default per model, retry counts, fallback order.
* **Provider:** `strict:true` schemas (OpenAI), parallel tools, XML prefill (Anthropic).
* **Policy:** read‑before‑edit strictness; at‑most‑one bash; bash timeout.
  These exactly match the knobs in your **optimization spec** and are represented in the `hpo.params` block above.&#x20;

---

### TL;DR

* **You keep tools in separate YAMLs.**
* **Configs** add *overlays/aliases* to rename/retarget tools, **dialect selection** with **provider‑native fallbacks**, and **prompt packs** you point at in `implementations/…`.
* **Modes** now include **Deep Plan** out of the box (Cline), plus **subagents & parallelism** (Augment), **plan→build→PR** (Copilot/Workspace), **patch‑first** (OpenCode), and **terminal‑first** (Crush).
* **HPO/RL/Evolution** are first‑class, mapping to your reward signals and W\&B config right now. &#x20;

If you want, I can also generate **JSON‑Schema** for this v2 config and stub loaders/validators, plus skeleton **clone packs** (prompt file paths + tool registries) for each product so you can drop your extracted prompts/schemas in and run.

***User***

I want to run an idea by you, that my help us a little. It would be a small change to the spec, but not a breaking change or anything significant.

There is one piece of this process that is bugging me in that it is the only remaining part that we hard-code behavior for, and use code for constructing prompts. That is the construction of tools available prompts and syntax explanations for each dialect/syntax type (i.e. pythonic, aider, opencode diffs, XML, or harmony as described by https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/openai-harmony). We previously tried a standard approach, then a 3-tiers of detail approach that was still hardcoded.

The fact is, this is part of the prompting process, and how we do this matters significantly. We will eventually *want* to evolve this just like we evolve the system prompts. However, the construction is programmatic. We need to construct individual explanations for each available tool in a standardized way. For pythonic tools, I always figured it should look like a normal python function def, with function name, arguments with types and defaults (and maybe comments), a return type hint, and a docstring for the description. We would translate our available tool into something like this:

```python
def create_tool_result_entry(
	tool_name: str, 
	tool_result: Dict[str, Any], 
	call_id: str = None,
	syntax_type: str = "custom-pythonic"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
	"""
	Create a tool result entry for the messages array
	"""
```

We would compile several of these, separated by newline, and each dialect would also have a section explaining *how* to do call these tools to start, before listing off these compiled examples. This would explain something like:

```python
function_call_description_template = (
        "\nYou may call a python functions to execute an action.\n"
        "To do so, you must wrap it in the following template:\n\n"
        "<TOOL_CALL> function_name(arg_1=value1, arg2=value2, ...) </TOOL_CALL>\n\n"
        "and it is wrapped as <TOOL_CALL> ... </TOOL_CALL>.\n"
        "The call MUST begin with the sequence \"<TOOL_CALL>\" and MUST end with the sequence \"</TOOL_CALL>\" to be valid.\n"
        "The inner content must be valid python code.\n\n"
        "Here are your available functions:\n\n{available_functions}\n\n"
        "Syntax: strictly use parentheses with comma-separated arguments and equal signs for keyword args.\n"
        "Example: my_tool(arg1=123, arg2=\"text\"). Do NOT use colons.\n"
    )
```

and we would wrap it in some XML like

```
<SYSTEM_MESSAGE>
...The compiled dialect explanation and available tool snippets.
</SYSTEM_MESSAGE>
```

We would also compiled several dialects with these prompts. This was all part of the engineering, but the behavior was hardcoded. Sometimes different approaches are necessary, like appending the above approach to the end of user messages for steering, but also having the cached and customizable, more extensive version at the end of the system prompt.

I think we should decouple, and try to create a more programmatic approach for these. They would be located in a new folder in `implementations`, `implementations/tool_prompt_synthesis`. Inside this folder, we could also group into their own folders by dialect, such as `pythonic`, `diffs` for all diff formats, etc.

My first idea was to store them as markdown, but actually use an XML process. Something like this for python:

```md
<ToolSnippet>
<tool.name>(<tool.arguments.map as="argument">
    <argument.name/><argument.type begin_with=" : " or=""/><argument.default begin_with="=" or=""/><argument.description begin_with=" # ">
</tool.arguments.map>)
    <tool.description begin_with='"""\n\t' end_with='\n\t"""'>

</ToolSnippet>
```

I actually think this is not that readable, but we want something that is readable like text but let's us basically do string programming. I again want you to help me figure out if this is a good idea, and if so, do some extensive thinking (and, if possible, reading on SoTA approaches to this if there are any, which there probably aren't many), and settle on a good abstraction to achieve this. I'm not extremely attached to this XML markdown idea, but I want something that is easy to read and understand, easy to manipulate (especially since we'll be either evolving it or doing RL on it, both with an LLM), and easy to write programs for. 

We have different needs here, as the system prompt is meant to steer behavior. In addition to the programming heavy ones like this, we would also have more word-heavy ones like the dialect explanation prompts stored in these folders, which won't have too much programming besides a little mapping tag for mapping the tools to the tool snippets. I'll even attach cursor's extracted system prompt here to show how they do it, and why we have our caching approach for customization. I'll also attach our tool and argument validation schema. I want you to really flesh out an optimal version of this, and describe how we can augment your schema with it.

We have already implemented a lot of your suggestions. I will attach our port spec and plan. We have made it up to milestone 9 I believe.



***Assistant***

Love this idea—treat the **tool‑catalog + dialect instructions** as *prompts that we synthesize*, not as hardcoded strings. It fits perfectly with your caching/evolution story for system prompts and lets you A/B and evolve the “how to call tools” guidance per model, mode and provider. Below is a concrete, non‑breaking addition to the v2 schema and runtime that makes this first‑class.

---

## TL;DR

Add a **Tool‑Prompt Synthesis Layer (TPSL)**:

* **Templates on disk** (Markdown + a tiny, safe templating subset) render:

  1. a *dialect explanation* (how to call tools, fences, examples) and
  2. a *catalog* of available tools (formatted per dialect: pythonic defs, XML, Harmony, Aider/udiff, etc.).
* **No code‑hardcoding**: per‑dialect *partials/snippets* on disk define the rendering of signatures, defaults, docstrings, etc.; the engine just supplies data and a sandboxed renderer.
* **Config‑driven**: which template to use, detail tier, placement (system/per‑turn), and fallback policy live in YAML next to your current `prompts` and `tools` sections (fully compatible with v2).&#x20;
* **Evolvable**: mark *mutable blocks* inside templates for the prompt‑evolver/HPO to mutate while keeping critical constraints frozen.&#x20;
* **Plugs into** your `EnhancedBaseDialect` (`get_system_prompt_section`, `format_tools_for_prompt`) with a small shim—so existing dialects keep working, but now get their content from templates.&#x20;

We also include a **Harmony** dialect option (models trained on Harmony often benefit when prompts follow its response format); templates can either emit Harmony text or, when using the official renderer, skip text and let the library produce the tokens. ([OpenAI Cookbook][1], [GitHub][2])

---

## Why now (and why this design)

* You already cache compiled system prompts and want to evolve them; the *tool catalog + dialect rules* decide *how well* models call tools and compose diffs, so they should be just as tunable as the system prompt. The extracted “Cursor‑style” system prompt you attached shows exactly why we want this cached + customizable.&#x20;
* Your v2 schema cleanly separates **prompts**, **tools**, **dialects**, **modes**—TPSL slots in between *prompts* and *dialects* with no breaking changes.&#x20;
* It aligns with your runtime: the *compiler* builds messages; *dialect manager* decides formats; *provider adapters* choose native vs text; *telemetry* and *evolver/HPO* can now optimize the tool catalog text too.&#x20;

---

## Directory & file layout

```
implementations/
  tool_prompt_synthesis/
    common/
      filters.json          # names of allowed filters & short docs
      examples/...
    pythonic/

      per_turn_short.j2.md
      _partials/
        signature_pydef.j2
        result_entry_pydef.j2

    harmony/
      system_full.j2.md
      _partials/
        call_wrapper.md     # or a note to use renderer
```

* **`.j2.md`** = Markdown + a small, sandboxed Jinja subset (loops/ifs/filters/includes only).
* Each dialect has **partials** for: call intro, guardrails, signature snippet, result entry format, examples.
* The engine provides the data model (tools + overlays), detail level, and any policy flags (e.g., “one bash per turn”).

> Rationale: Markdown is readable for humans/LLMs; Jinja‑subset lets us loop over tools and vary detail tiers; we keep logic tiny and safe via a sandboxed environment (no arbitrary eval or imports).

---

## Data model the templates receive

Each template sees a simple dict (built from your existing types):

```yaml
dialect: "pythonic" | "unified_diff" | "aider" | "anthropic_xml" | "harmony"
detail: "full" | "short" | "minimal"
policy:
  one_bash_per_turn: true
  read_before_edit: "error"
  create_file_policy: { unified_diff: { use_dev_null: true } }
tools:
  - name: "run_shell"
    display_name: "bash"             # from overlays
    description: "Execute a short shell command."
    blocking: true
    max_per_turn: 1
    parameters:
      - { name: "cmd", type: "string", required: true, description: "Command to run" }
      - { name: "timeout", type: "int", required: false, default: 45 }
    return_type: "ToolResult"
    provider_native: { openai: true, anthropic: true }
    syntax_style: "bash_block"
```

This comes directly from your **tool YAML loader + overlays** (rename/description/syntax/fallbacks) so you don’t edit base tool files to change presentation.&#x20;

---

## Example templates (readable, evolvable)

### 1) Pythonic catalog (`pythonic/system_full.j2.md`)

````md
{% include "_partials/guardrails.md" %}

{% include "_partials/call_intro.md" %}

{% for t in tools %}
```python
def {{ t.display_name or t.name }}(
    {%- for p in t.parameters -%}
    {{ p.name }}{% if p.type %}: {{ p.type }}{% endif %}{% if p.default is not none %}={{ p.default|py_literal }}{% endif %}{{ ", " if not loop.last }}
    {%- endfor -%}
){% if t.return_type %} -> {{ t.return_type }}{% endif %}:
    """{{ t.description }}"""
````

{% if detail != "minimal" %}

* **Constraints**: {% if t.blocking %}blocking{% else %}non‑blocking{% endif %}{% if t.max\_per\_turn %}; max/turn={{t.max\_per\_turn}}{% endif %}
* **Preferred syntax**: {{ t.syntax\_style|default("pythonic") }}
  {% endif %}

{% endfor %}

{% if detail == "full" %}

### Examples

{% include "\_partials/result\_entry\_pydef.j2" %}
{% endif %}

````

- The `py_literal` filter prints defaults correctly (strings quoted, lists rendered).  
- The “Examples” partial is *mutable*—your evolver can change examples without touching signatures.

### 2) Unified‑diff dialect explainer (excerpt)

```md
**How to propose edits (Unified Diff):**

- Generate a valid git unified diff. Avoid line numbers; provide 3–5 lines of context.
- For **new files**, use `--- /dev/null` and `+++ b/<path>` (the patcher will create the file).  
- Use small, logically grouped hunks; do not mix unrelated changes.

{% for t in tools if t.name in ["apply_unified_patch", "read_file"] %}
- Available helper: `{{ t.display_name or t.name }}` — {{ t.description }}
{% endfor %}
````

This matches your add‑file policy and patcher behavior.&#x20;

### 3) Anthropic XML tool‑use guidance (snippet)

````md
**Anthropic tool‑use format**

- When you need a tool, emit a single `<tool>` block with `name="..."` and a `<arguments>` JSON body.
- Keep args minimal; respect required/optional flags shown below.

{% for t in tools %}
```xml
<tool name="{{ t.name }}">
  <arguments>{
    {%- for p in t.parameters -%}
    "{{ p.name }}": {{ p | example_value }}{{ ", " if not loop.last }}
    {%- endfor -%}
  }</arguments>
</tool>
````

{% endfor %}

````

### 4) Harmony dialect (two options)

- **Text mode**: emit Harmony‑formatted instructions and function calls via your template, just like above.  
- **Renderer mode**: skip text emission; the provider adapter uses **OpenAI’s `harmony` renderer** to build the conversation/messages and function calls (recommended when using gpt‑oss models trained on Harmony). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

> We’ll expose a boolean `render_with_library` in config to switch. If `true`, the TPSL returns a small “placeholder” note and the adapter constructs tokens via the Harmony renderer.

---

## Augmenting the **v2 schema** (non‑breaking)

Add a `tool_prompt_synthesis` block under `prompts`. Everything else stays the same.

```yaml
prompts:
  packs:
    base:
      system: implementations/system_prompts/default.md
      # ...
  injection:
    system_order:
      - "@pack(base).system"
      - "[CACHE] tools_catalog_full"   # ← now produced by TPSL
    per_turn_order:
      - "mode_specific"
      - "tools_catalog_short"
  cache:
    enabled: true
    key: "sha256(config+prompts+toolset+TPSL)"

  # NEW
  tool_prompt_synthesis:
    enabled: true
    dialects:
      pythonic:
        system_full: implementations/tool_prompt_synthesis/pythonic/system_full.j2.md
        per_turn_short: implementations/tool_prompt_synthesis/pythonic/per_turn_short.j2.md
      unified_diff:
        system_full: implementations/tool_prompt_synthesis/unified_diff/system_full.j2.md
      aider:
        system_full: implementations/tool_prompt_synthesis/aider/system_full.j2.md
      anthropic_xml:
        system_full: implementations/tool_prompt_synthesis/anthropic_xml/system_full.j2.md
      harmony:
        system_full: implementations/tool_prompt_synthesis/harmony/system_full.j2.md
        render_with_library: false  # true → provider uses OpenAI harmony renderer
    selection:
      by_model:
        "openrouter/openai/*": pythonic
        "anthropic/*": anthropic_xml
        "gpt-oss/*": harmony
      by_mode:
        plan: pythonic
        build: unified_diff
    detail:
      system: full
      per_turn: short
    evolution:
      enabled: true
      mutable_blocks: ["guardrails.md", "call_intro.md", "examples/*"]
      frozen_blocks: ["_partials/signature_pydef.j2", "_partials/result_entry_pydef.j2"]
````

* The compiled **tools catalog** strings are fed into your existing `injection.system_order` / `per_turn_order` slots and cached with the same hash key you’re already using—just extended to include TPSL.&#x20;
* This is **fully compatible** with your current `tools.registry` + **overlays** (rename/description/syntax/fallbacks).&#x20;

---

## Runtime integration (tiny shim, big payoff)

1. **PromptCompiler**

   * Adds `ToolPromptSynthesisEngine.render(dialect_id, detail, tools, policy)` and writes two strings: `tools_catalog_full`, `tools_catalog_short`.
   * Appends them where your config says (`injection.system_order` / `per_turn_order`). Cached by `sha256(config+prompts+toolset+TPSL)`.&#x20;

2. **EnhancedBaseDialect**

   * `format_tools_for_prompt(tools)` now calls TPSL with the dialect inferred from `tools.dialects.selection`; or bypasses (provider‑native only). Backward compatible—if `tool_prompt_synthesis.enabled=false`, it falls back to old behavior.&#x20;

3. **Provider adapters**

   * If `harmony.render_with_library=true` and model is Harmony‑trained, the **adapter** uses the Harmony renderer to build messages instead of injecting TPSL text. ([OpenAI Cookbook][1], [GitHub][2])

4. **Telemetry**

   * Log `TPSL.template_id`, `detail`, and `dialect_id` per turn. This feeds HPO and the evolver exactly like your existing prompt optimization.&#x20;

---

## Evolution & HPO (how it learns)

* The prompt‑evolver targets **mutable blocks** (guardrails, call intro, examples) and **detail switches**—*not* the signature partials—so the syntax stays valid while the wording improves. Your optimization spec and reward shaping already support evaluating these changes against PAS/HMR/ACS/TPF/TE/LE.&#x20;
* WandB sweeps can flip:

  * `selection.by_model` (e.g., Claude → Aider S/R vs Unified Diff),
  * `detail.system/per_turn`,
  * per‑dialect guardrail wording variants,
  * add‑file guidance strength (udiff `/dev/null` vs tool write).

All of this matches your HPO knobs and reward model.&#x20;

---

## Quality & safety rails in the templates

* **Token‑aware**: TPSL exposes `num_tools`; templates can branch to a compressed list when many tools are enabled:
  `{{ " (N tools; see short catalog below)" if tools|length > 12 }}`
* **Determinism**: forbid randomization; environment is a **sandboxed Jinja** (no Python eval, only whitelisted filters like `indent`, `json`, `py_literal`).
* **Validator alignment**: include render‑time flags for `one_bash_per_turn`, `read_before_edit: error/warn`, and `create_file_policy`; keep these text rules in sync with runtime validators.
* **Diff correctness**: udiff templates **always** show `/dev/null` add‑file semantics to match your patcher (or recommend `write_file` under Aider).&#x20;

---

## Port plan (small addition to your v2 plan)

Insert **Milestone 2.5: Tool‑Prompt Synthesis** right after “Prompt Packs and Injection.”&#x20;

**Scope**

* TPSL engine (sandboxed Jinja subset), directory watcher + cache keying.
* Minimal data model adapter (from `EnhancedToolDefinition` + overlays).
* Built‑in templates for `pythonic`, `unified_diff`, `aider`, `anthropic_xml`, `harmony`.
* Unit tests: render with 2–3 tools; assert add‑file guidance; compare token sizes; ensure cache hits.

**No breakage**: if `tool_prompt_synthesis.enabled=false`, you keep current behavior.

---

## Example outputs (condensed)

**Pythonic (full)**

```python
def bash(cmd: str, timeout: int=45) -> ToolResult:
    """Execute a short shell command."""
```

**Unified Diff explainer (short)**

> Generate a valid git unified diff. For new files, use `--- /dev/null` and `+++ b/<path>`. Keep hunks small and related.

**Anthropic XML tool example**

```xml
<tool name="read_file">
  <arguments>{"path": "src/main.py"}</arguments>
</tool>
```

**Harmony note**
If renderer is enabled, we don’t inject text; the provider constructs the Harmony messages via the official library. ([OpenAI Cookbook][1], [GitHub][2])

## How this connects to the rest of RayCoder

* Works with your **LSP‑enhanced sandbox** and **Ray + gVisor** stack unchanged.&#x20;
* Hooks neatly into your **EnhancedBaseDialect** and **provider‑native** adapters.&#x20;
* Extends your **v2 schema** without breaking earlier configs.&#x20;
* Immediately usable by your **optimization/evolution** pipeline.&#x20;

---

## Next steps I recommend

1. Land **Milestone 2.5** (TPSL engine + minimal templates: pythonic/unified‑diff).&#x20;
2. Move your current hardcoded “3 detail tiers” into templates under `pythonic/` and `unified_diff/`.
3. Flip the v2 configs to:

```yaml
prompts.injection.system_order:
  - "@pack(base).system"
  - "[CACHE] tools_catalog_full"

prompts.tool_prompt_synthesis.enabled: true
```

4. Add a tiny **A/B sweep** over:

   * pythonic vs anthropic\_xml in plan mode,
   * unified\_diff vs aider in build mode,
   * full vs short detail for per‑turn,
   * Harmony renderer on/off for gpt‑oss models.&#x20;

If you want, I can also draft the initial **`system_full.j2.md`** for `pythonic` and `unified_diff` plus the safe filter list and a 50‑line `ToolPromptSynthesisEngine` stub that plugs into your compiler with the right cache key.
