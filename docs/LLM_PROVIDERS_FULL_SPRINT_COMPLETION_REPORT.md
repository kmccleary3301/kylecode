## Overview
This document summarizes the end state of the LLM Providers Full Sprint. The sprint focused on wiring KyleCode's agentic runtime to support OpenAI (Chat + Responses), OpenRouter (OpenAI-compatible), and Anthropic Messages with native tool calling, reasoning trace handling, streaming fallbacks, and caching metadata. The work was guided by the [LLM Providers Full Sprint Plan](../LLM_PROVIDERS_FULL_SPRINT_PLAN.md) and extends the broader Phase 2 goals of modular provider support, safer logging, and tool orchestration.

## Sprint Objectives Recap
The plan outlined five major milestones:
1. **Runtime Abstraction & State Foundations** – Create a provider runtime registry, normalize provider results, and extend session state with provider metadata and reasoning trace storage.
2. **OpenAI & OpenRouter Runtime Support** – Deliver Chat Completions and Responses runtimes with streaming fallbacks, encrypted reasoning handling, conversation threading, and OpenRouter compatibility.
3. **Anthropic Runtime & Tool Flow** – Implement Anthropic Messages runtime with cache-awareness, thinking block treatment, and streaming support.
4. **Logging, Telemetry, and Fallbacks** – Ensure logging v2 captures provider interactions while redacting sensitive payloads, and propagate streaming fallback signals to user-facing channels.
5. **Testing & Validation** – Add providers-focused tests, execute existing suites in the `ray_sce_test` environment, and document verification steps.

## Key Deliverables
- **Provider Runtime Registry (`agentic_coder_prototype/provider_runtime.py`)**
  - Added `ProviderRuntimeRegistry`, shared message/result dataclasses, and base utilities for OpenAI-compatible runtimes.
  - Implemented OpenAI Chat and Responses runtimes with unified streaming fallbacks, conversation metadata handling, and encrypted reasoning capture.
  - Added Anthropic Messages runtime with structured message conversion, support for `cache_control` metadata, tool call extraction, and streaming via `client.messages.stream`.
  - Hardened runtime error handling to capture provider-side non-JSON payloads (HTML throttling pages, malformed responses). The runtimes now retain raw HTTP bodies, propagate the first 400 characters plus HTTP status, and surface structured diagnostics through `ProviderRuntimeError.details`.
- **Session & Reasoning State Enhancements**
  - `SessionState` now stores provider metadata and hooks into a `ReasoningTraceStore` to manage encrypted traces and shareable summaries.
- **Streaming Fallback & Provider Fault UX**
  - The main conductor logs `[streaming-disabled]` warnings to the markdown logger, console, and logging v2 transcript whenever a provider rejects streaming, ensuring deterministic behavior on retry.
  - On any provider exception, the conductor now records a transcript entry, prints a `[provider-error]` line with hint/traceback/snippet, and archives the structured error under `logging/<run>/errors/turn_<n>.json` for later analysis.
- **Smoke Test Harness**
  - Authored `industry_coder_refs/scripts/smoke_anthropic_sonnet4.py` to exercise Anthropic streaming end-to-end with capped tokens and temperature.
- **Unit & Integration Coverage**
  - Added tests in `tests/providers/` for Anthropic streaming normalization and OpenRouter client configuration.
  - Confirmed all provider suites and key regression tests pass under `ray_sce_test`.
  - Exercised new Grok/OpenRouter scenarios manually (streaming, tool validation, rate limiting). Logged traces capture the error payloads for future debugging.
- **Dependency Upgrades**
  - Bumped `anthropic` to `>=0.31.0` in `requirements.txt` to access the modern streaming API surface.

## Testing and Verification
- **Automated Tests**
  - `conda run --no-capture-output -n ray_sce_test pytest tests/providers -q`
  - Regression suites previously run during sprint: `tests/test_openai_agentic_skeleton.py`, `tests/test_dialect_selection_v2.py`, `tests/test_schema_v2_loader.py`, `tests/test_logging_v2_basic.py`, among others noted in the prior handoff summary.
- **Manual Smoke & Load Tests**
  - `conda run --no-capture-output -n ray_sce_test python industry_coder_refs/scripts/smoke_anthropic_sonnet4.py --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
    - Output tokens: 20, Input tokens: 19, confirmed streaming path, and provided sample haiku response.
  - Multiple Grok (OpenRouter) runs at 20+ turns to confirm tool validation, reasoning output ingestion, non-streaming fallback, and error capture. Runs highlighted OpenRouter throttling behaviour (`slow_down`, HTML error pages) which now surfaces cleanly in console and `logging/<run>/errors/` artifacts.

## Outstanding Items and Open Questions
- **Provider Config Surface**
  - Additional configuration validation (e.g., ensuring `provider_tools.anthropic.temperature` stays within safe bounds) is left to future schema work.
  - Grok/OpenRouter profiles currently share the OpenAI adapter. If OpenRouter exposes native tooling or divergent request shapes we will need provider-specific adapters and tests.
- **Streaming Telemetry**
  - While fallback warnings are logged, telemetry aggregation for streaming success/fail ratios is not yet exposed in dashboards.
- **Cache-Control Policies**
  - The Anthropic runtime records cache usage fields; further experiments are needed to exploit ephemeral caches for repeated prompts.
- **Native Tool Expansion**
  - OpenRouter currently piggybacks on OpenAI schemas. If non-OpenAI models become available through OpenRouter, additional gating logic may be required.
- **Environment Packaging**
  - The smoke script resides under `industry_coder_refs/scripts/` because `docs/` and some ancillary folders are gitignored; relocate if a consolidated tooling directory is preferred.
- **Rate Limiting & Error Backoff**
  - OpenRouter frequently returns throttling HTML pages (`slow_down`). The runtime now captures snippets, but the agent still aborts after the first failure. A retry/backoff policy may be desirable for higher reliability.
- **Tool Validation Messaging**
  - Discovered and fixed a missing `errors` field in tool-validation responses. No additional bugs observed, but future validators should include structured details to avoid regressions.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Provider API Drift**
  - Keep SDK versions pinned (`openai>=1.0.0`, `anthropic>=0.31.0`) and monitor release notes; runtime registry isolates most breaking changes.
- **Credential Management**
  - `.env` loading is best-effort and avoids overwriting existing variables, but follow-on work should consider integrating with a secrets manager for production.
- **Streaming Costs**
  - Streaming fallback prevents hard failures but may double-call in rare cases. Continue monitoring usage for cost spikes.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Centralize Smoke Scripts**: Move `industry_coder_refs/scripts/smoke_anthropic_sonnet4.py` into the primary `scripts/` directory and wire it into CI (behind a secret guard) if automated verification is desired.
2. **Telemetry Dashboards**: Expose streaming status, rate-limit incidents, and cache hit metrics from `SessionState.provider_metadata` / `logging/<run>/errors/` into existing telemetry pipelines.
3. **Provider Schema Validation**: Expand schema checks to enforce safe limits on provider-specific knobs (temperature, cache TTL, etc.). Add config linting for Grok/OpenRouter to guard against unsupported settings.
4. **Retry & Backoff Policy**: Implement optional retry/backoff in `_invoke_runtime_with_streaming` for transient HTTP failures (e.g., `slow_down`, network blips).
5. **Future Provider Integrations**: The runtime registry makes adding new providers straightforward—document the process for Azure OpenAI or Google Gemini if they enter scope.
