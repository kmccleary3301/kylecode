Enumerate the repository workspace:

1. List the top-level directories and files in a concise tree format (no more than two levels deep).
2. Highlight important source files (C headers, sources, build/test entry points).
3. Provide a short summary (2â€“3 bullet points).
4. When you have completed the task, call `mark_task_complete()`.
