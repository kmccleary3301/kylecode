Thanks for sharing the docs—yes, your abstraction is **very** close to what I meant by a tiny, explicit IR + capability‑based adapters. Below I’ll map your spec to those best practices, then point out a few concrete upgrades that will make it even more future‑proof.

---

## Where you’re already on target

* **Runtime/adapter boundary is clear.** You’ve defined a `ProviderRuntime` interface, a registry, and provider‑specific runtimes (OpenAI Chat/Responses, Anthropic, OpenRouter) that normalize tool calls/results and expose capabilities. That’s exactly the seam I recommend. 

* **Provider adapters translate schemas—not your core.** Your adapters generate the right tool definitions per API (OpenAI Chat’s externally‑tagged “functions”, Responses’ internally‑tagged tools, Anthropic’s `input_schema`) and correlate tool calls/outputs (`call_id`, `tool_use_id`). This matches the “adapters do the churn” principle. 

* **Reasoning traces handled safely.** You plan for OpenAI’s encrypted reasoning items and keep them out of user logs; you show how to surface only safe summaries. That’s precisely the “don’t let chain‑of‑thought leak into storage/UI” rule. 

* **Streaming normalization and cancellation.** You treat OpenAI Responses as typed events, Anthropic as content‑block deltas, and OpenRouter as SSE lines (with keep‑alive comments), and you route everything through a shared streaming multiplexer. ✔️ 

* **Caching is a first‑class concern.** You call out OpenAI auto‑caching and Anthropic `cache_control` with TTLs (5m/1h) and encourage stable system/tool content—this is exactly where most teams skip detail and pay for it later. 

* **Text‑tool fallbacks are preserved.** You keep a text‑based dialect path (bash, diffs, etc.) when native tools aren’t reliable—good separation of concerns. 

* **Testing & failure hygiene.** You added fixtures for provider streaming, captured mid‑stream errors/throttling (e.g., OpenRouter `slow_down` HTML), and hardened error reporting. Great practice. 

**Verdict:** architecturally aligned. You’re solving the same problems with nearly the same abstractions.

## What I’d tighten to make it “future‑proof”

1. **Make the IR *the* source of truth (and version it).**
   You already mention “shared message/result dataclasses,” but make them an explicit, **vendor‑neutral IR** and store only this IR + `provider_meta` blobs. Add `ir_version` and `adapter_version` to every persisted trace so migrations are surgical. (Keep raw HTTP/error snippets only for forensics, never for business logic.) 

**Minimal IR (TypeScript)**

```ts
type Role = "system"|"user"|"assistant"|"tool";
type Part =
  | { type:"text"; text:string }
  | { type:"json"; value:unknown }
  | { type:"media"; kind:"image"|"audio"|"video"|"blob"; uri:string; mime?:string };

type Message = { id:string; role:Role; parts:Part[]; corr_id?:string; tags?:string[]; time?:string };
type ToolCall = { id:string; name:string; args:unknown; group?:string };     // group = parallel intent
type ToolResult = { tool_call_id:string; ok:boolean; result?:unknown; error?:{code:string;message:string} };
type DeltaEvent = { cursor:string; type:"text"|"tool_call"|"reasoning_meta"|"logprob"|"finish"; payload:any };
type Finish = { reason:"stop"|"tool_call"|"length"|"error"; usage:{prompt:number;completion:number;cache_hit?:boolean}; provider_meta?:any };

type ConversationIR = { id:string; ir_version:"1"; messages:Message[] };
```

2. **Capability negotiation as data, not code paths.**
   You already expose “capabilities” from each runtime; push that farther and let planners decide strategies from a matrix (e.g., `tool_calls: parallel|sequential`, `streaming: text_deltas|event_deltas`, `json_mode: strict|best_effort`, `reasoning: available|redacted|none`). This prevents branching all over the executor when APIs drift. 

3. **Normalize *parallel intent*.**
   Anthropic can emit multiple `tool_use` blocks in one turn and requires you to reply with all `tool_result`s at once; other providers may serialize. Express the intent in the IR via `ToolCall.group`, and have adapters down‑compile to serial when needed. This keeps planner logic provider‑agnostic. 

4. **One event bus for streaming everywhere.**
   Emit only `DeltaEvent` types from all runtimes (`text`, `tool_call`, `reasoning_meta`, `finish`) and assemble transcripts in one place. You already have a “streaming multiplexer”; defining these event invariants makes UI/telemetry dead simple. 

5. **Reasoning hygiene: summary vs state.**
   You already plan to persist encrypted reasoning and display safe summaries. Add an invariant: summaries are **never** fed back; continuity uses Conversations/`previous_response_id` or encrypted reasoning items only. (Your docs already imply this—codify it.) 

6. **Telemetry unification.**
   Emit a provider‑agnostic usage record `{prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, cache_read_tokens?, cache_write_tokens?, model, adapter_version}` on `finish`, regardless of where the provider reports it (Responses message_start vs final payload, Anthropic usage block, OpenRouter wrapper). This makes cache ROI and rate‑limit analysis straightforward. 

7. **Retry/backoff policy for transient failures.**
   Your completion report notes OpenRouter throttling/HTML error pages; wire an exponential backoff with a budgeted retry strategy into the runtime boundary so callers don’t each reinvent it. 

8. **Conformance tests as fixtures.**
   You already have streaming and adapter tests; add record/replay fixtures per provider release and property tests to assert IR invariants (e.g., *every* tool call must be matched by a tool result or a terminal `finish(reason="error")`).

## Quick scorecard

| Dimension                   | Status                            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Adapter boundary & registry | ✅ Strong (keep)                   |
| Reasoning trace handling    | ✅ Strong (keep)                   |
| Streaming normalization     | ✅ Strong (keep)                   |
| Caching model               | ✅ Strong (keep)                   |
| Explicit, versioned IR      | ⚠️ Partial—promote to first‑class |
| Capability negotiation      | ⚠️ Partial—formalize matrix       |
| Parallel tool groups        | ⚠️ Add `group` intent to IR       |
| Telemetry + backoff         | ⚠️ Add unified metrics & retries  |

**Overall:** You’re ~85–90% aligned. The main improvement is to make your IR *explicit and versioned* and to drive behavior from **capabilities + events**, not from provider SDK quirks.
