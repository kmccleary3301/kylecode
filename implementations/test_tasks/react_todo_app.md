Task: Build a minimal React + TypeScript Todo app with a clean component structure and basic tests.

Requirements:
- Initialize a React + TypeScript project (Vite or CRA) inside the workspace.
- Components:
  - `App.tsx` renders a `TodoList` and an input/form to add todos
  - `TodoList.tsx` renders a list with delete and toggle-done controls
- State management: lightweight (useState + lifting state). No external state libs.
- Styling: simple CSS modules or styled-components; keep minimal.
- Testing: add one test verifying adding and toggling a todo (Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library).
- Linting/formatting: ESLint + Prettier configured for TS.
- Commands to run:
  - `npm ci` (or `pnpm i`)
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm test -s`
- Deliverables: a working build and a passing unit test.
